 BattleBox is a 2-player game made for the Mocs Arcade. It was made in a week using the Godot game engine.

 Godot is an open-sourced, royalty-free game engine made to be accessible, easy to pick up, and powerful!

### What is this game?

Battlebox is a fun and addicting one-on-one platformer game for the Mocs Arcade library. The game was made by a UTC Alumni (that's me!) wanting to increase the range of the arcade's games. It's my hope that this game will show that you don't have to make God of War to make something people will enjoy. I want to encourage other students to make their own games!

Making games may seem daunting at first, but game engines have come a long way, and you can easily learn to make games for free with the right resources. Itch.io also has a wealth of royalty-free assets for people who love programming, but don't want to make art or music. Everything you need is a question away! Go chase it!

### Compiling the game

To run/compile this game, download Godot at godotengine.org and import the project.godot file at the root of this repository.

### Learning Godot

Godot does not have professional courses like Unity or Unreal, but besides for its intuitive design, it enjoys a supportive community and several youtube series on how to make games using it. I would recommend starting with [Heartbeast's](https://www.youtube.com/user/uheartbeast) or [GDQuest's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxboW7x0jZqFdvMdCFKTMsQ) fantastic tutorials.

### Contacting Me

Should I be doing this? Ah, well, I'd love your questions! Heck, if you have potential additions to this game, I'd love to hear them!

Github's ISSUE system automatically emails the repo owner when they get made. So yeah. Make an issue on this repo and I'll respond! Probably.

It doesn't have to be about anything in particular. Let's just talk! :)
